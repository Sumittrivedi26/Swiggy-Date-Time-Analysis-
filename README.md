# Swiggy-Date-Time-Analysis-
This project analyzes Swiggy’s date-time data using Snowflake to uncover trends in order placement, delivery times, and peak hours. It focuses on identifying time-based patterns and optimizing delivery efficiency. The analysis leverages Snowflake’s powerful data processing capabilities.

Date-Time Analysis: 

Identifying trends such as peak hours, most common order days, and order durations.

Time-based Filtering: Analyzing orders placed during specific time intervals (e.g., 5 PM to 8 PM) to identify delays and trends.
 
performance Metrics: Calculating order duration and identifying factors affecting delivery times.
 
Technology Stack: Snowflake (for data warehousing), SQL (for querying and analysis).

Goals:
	
Gain actionable insights from Swiggy’s order and delivery data.
 
Improve understanding of peak hours and order delays.
 
Optimize delivery operations based on time-based trends.
